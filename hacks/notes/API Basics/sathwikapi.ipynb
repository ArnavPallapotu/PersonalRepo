    "### Functional completeness (search, suggestions, persistence)\n",
    "Evidence:\n",
    "- Search input (`#filterInput`) accepts terms and triggers searches on Enter or chip click. See event wiring in `hacks/music-api.md`.\n",
    "- Suggestion chips: clicking a chip fills the input and runs a search immediately — implemented in `renderAllSuggestions()` and wired to `fetchDataWithSave()`.\n",
    "- Recent searches persist across sessions using `localStorage` under the key `RECENT_KEY`. Behavior: deduplication (term moved to front), cap to 10 entries, and a Clear action implemented in `renderRecentSearches()` and `saveRecentSearch()`.\n",
    "- UX: suggestions are shown while typing (`showSuggestions()`), recents are shown beneath suggestions, and the UI updates immediately after a search. This satisfies the rubric requirement for a demonstrable, persistent search history and helpful suggestions."

   "source": [
    "### Code quality, modularity, and documentation\n",
    "Evidence:\n",
    "- Separation of concerns: network logic is in the `Requestor` (existing module), UI rendering is handled by `render*` helpers, and persistence/normalization is centralized in `fetchDataWithSave()`.\n",
    "- Comments: functions handling recent-search persistence (`loadRecentSearches`, `saveRecentSearch`, `renderRecentSearches`) include explanatory comments describing behavior, edge cases, and format of stored data.\n",
    "- Defensive coding: `loadRecentSearches()` wraps `JSON.parse` in try/catch and returns a safe array on failure; `saveRecentSearch()` deduplicates and enforces a size cap.\n",
    "- Extensibility: adding analytics, server-side sync, or testing hooks requires minimal changes due to clear function boundaries."
